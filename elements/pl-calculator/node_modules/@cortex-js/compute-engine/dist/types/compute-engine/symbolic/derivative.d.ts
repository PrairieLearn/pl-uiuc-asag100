 * Calculate the partial derivative of an expression with respect to a

 * All expressions that do not explicitly depend on `v` are taken to have zero
 * partial derivative.
 *
 * ## Recursion Safety
 *
 * This function includes a depth limit (`MAX_DIFFERENTIATION_DEPTH`) to prevent
 * stack overflow from pathological expressions. The depth is tracked internally
 * and incremented on each recursive call. If the limit is reached, the function
 * returns `undefined` rather than continuing to recurse.
 *
 * Normal differentiation (including higher-order derivatives of complex
 * expressions) should never approach this limit. Hitting the limit indicates
 * either a bug in the differentiation rules or a maliciously constructed input.
 *
 * @param expr - The expression to differentiate
 * @param v - The variable to differentiate with respect to
 * @param depth - Internal recursion depth counter (do not pass manually)
 * @returns The derivative expression, or `undefined` if unable to differentiate
