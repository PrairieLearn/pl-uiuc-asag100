/**
 * Logarithm simplification rules consolidated from simplify-rules.ts.
 * Handles ~30 patterns for simplifying Ln and Log expressions.
 *
 * Categories:
 * - Ln power rules: ln(x^n) -> n*ln(x)
 * - Log power rules: log_c(x^n) -> n*log_c(x)
 * - Logarithm combinations: ln(x) + ln(y) -> ln(xy)
 * - Change of base rules
 * - Logarithm with infinity
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Do not call .simplify() on results to avoid infinite recursion.
