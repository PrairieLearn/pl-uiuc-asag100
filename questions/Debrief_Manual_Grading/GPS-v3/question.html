        <p>General Grading Instruction:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Grade each numbered response only against the corresponding rubric item. Do not use or infer information
                from other parts of the student’s answer when evaluating a specific item.</li>
            <li>Do not re-interpret or “fix” student language. If the answer is vague, unclear, or incorrect, mark the
                item incorrect.</li>
            <li>Do not make assumptions / extrapolations based on students answers</li>
