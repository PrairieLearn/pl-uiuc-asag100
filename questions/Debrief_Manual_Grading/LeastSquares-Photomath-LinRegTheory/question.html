                <li>You should discuss the solution with your team.</li>
                <li>You are not allowed to get assistance from Large Language Models.</li>
                <li>Just like with any other GA question, you can get assistance from course staff.</li>
                <li>Handwrite (and do not type) your solution. Do not submit code.
                    However, you may use a Python interpreter for calculations if needed.</li>
                <li>You can use a tablet for handwritting, but if you do so, make sure you upload the screenshot figure.
                    Do not take a photo of the tablet screen.</li>
                <li>Consider taking the photo of your scratch paper using your phone ("Use phone" button) instead of the
                    computer webcam. You can usually get better lighting this way.</li>

    <p>You are given the following data points:</p>
    <p>$(1,2), (1,4), (2,3), (4,5), (5,6)$</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Create a plot of these points on a set of axes. This should be hand drawn. Do not use code or computer
            software. It does not need to be perfect, but keep the same scale for x and y coordinates.</li>
        <li>On your plot, sketch a line that you believe provides a reasonable least squares best-fit approximation to
            the data. Do not compute the exact least squares solution. Use your understanding of how least squares
            behaves to draw the line.</li>
        <li>Briefly explain your reasoning for the best fit line. In your explanation, include:
            <ul>
                <li>What quantity is minimized in linear least squares, and</li>
                <li>How your sketch reflects minimizing that quantity.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>There is a known relationship between the means of the data, $(\bar{x}, \bar{y})$, and the least squares
            best-fit line. State this relationship, and show it clearly on your plot.</li>
        <li>Suppose the point (5,6) got moved upward to (5,9), while the other points remained the same. Describe
            qualitatively how the best-fit line would change (for example: slope, intercept, or general direction).
            Justify your reasoning.</li>
