  <p>
    You are given the linear system $\mathbf{Ax} = \mathbf{b}$, with $\mathbf{A} = {{params.arep}}$, $\mathbf{b} =
    {{params.brep}}$. Your task is to solve this system and answer the questions below. All work must be shown by hand,
    including intermediate steps. Do not use a computer or code to solve this problem.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Compute the true solution $\mathbf{x}$.</li>
    <li>Suppose an iterative method is used to solve this linear system of equations, and an approximated solution is
      $\hat{\mathbf{x}} = {{params.estrep}}$. Compute the residual $\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{b} -
      \mathbf{A}\hat{\mathbf{x}}$.</li>
    <li>Compute the error $\mathbf{e} = \mathbf{x} - \hat{\mathbf{x}}$.</li>
    <li>Which one should be used as stopping criteria for an iterative solver: error or residual? Explain your choice.
    </li>
  </ul>

    <p>The true solution is $\mathbf{x} = {{params.xrep}}$. </p>
    <p>The residual is $\mathbf{r} = {{params.resrep}}$. </p>
    <p>The error is $\mathbf{e} = {{params.errrep}}$. </p>
    <p>Iterative solvers can use the residual as stopping criteria. The error cannot be used, because the true solution
      is not known during an iterative process.</p>
