    <p> You want to use normalized power iteration method to find the largest eigenvalue and corresponding eigenvector
        of a matrix. </p>

    <p> <strong>Example 1</strong>: matrix A has two dominant eigenvalues that are close in magnitude and have the same
        sign.</p>

    <ol>
        <li> Would the method work for matrix A? I.e., will it find the correct largest eigenvalue and corresponding
            eigenvector?</li>
        <li> What can you say about the convergence of the method in this situation?</li>
        <li> Justify your answer above.</li>
    </ol>

    <p> <strong>Example 2</strong>: matrix B has the two dominant eigenvalues with the same sign and magnitude.</p>

    <ol>
        <li> Would the method work for matrix B ? I.e., will it find the correct largest eigenvalue and corresponding
            eigenvector?</li>
        <li> Justify your answer above.</li>
    </ol>
