	<p>Answer the questions below:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>When providing the Gradient to the <a
				href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.minimize.html"
				target="_blank">scipy.optimize.
				minimize</a> function, does the number of function evaluations decrease or increase? </li>
		<li>Briefly explain the answer above.</li>
		<li>If you use the method "Newton-CG" without providing the gradient, you will notice the method will fail. This
			happens because the Newton-CG method uses the Gradient to approximate the Hessian. Now try to run the method
			"CG" with and without the Gradient. It should work. What do you notice in terms of function evaluations when
			comparing the "CG" method with and without the Gradient?</li>
		<li>Briefly explain the answer above.</li>
		<li>Change the seed to 14 (run
			<code>solve_optimization(14, num_cities, tol, "Newton-CG", use_gradient=True )</code>).The visualization
			(plot) will be different. Do you think there is something wrong with the optimization, or is this just a
			plotting artifact?
		</li>
		<li>Briefly explain the answer above.</li>

		<p>General Grading Instruction:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Grade each numbered response only against the corresponding rubric item. Do not infer information from
				other parts of the student’s answer when evaluating a specific item. It is okay to use another item
				answer if student explicitly indicates that an answer from a given item is the same as the one for
				another item (just don't make assumptions!).</li>
			<li>Do not re-interpret or “fix” student language. If the answer is vague, unclear, or incorrect, mark the
				item incorrect.</li>
			<li>Do not make assumptions / extrapolations based on students answers</li>
		</ol>
