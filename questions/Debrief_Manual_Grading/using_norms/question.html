        You are working with satellite images to monitor deforestation. The images are represented as large numerical
        matrices, one matrix for each time instance.
        Each matrix row corresponds to different measurements (e.g., temperature, vegetation index, soil moisture), and
        each column corresponds to a different location. All measurements are normalized so that differences in variance
        between them do not affect the analysis.
    </p>
    <p>You read that you can use the norm to measure how much the landscape has changed over time. Should you take the
        norm of the difference between two images or the difference of the norms of each image? Explain your answer.
    </p>
    <p> For this example, what does a larger norm value indicate compared to a smaller one? </p>

        They should take the norm of the difference between two images.
        Students can give different explanations to get this question marked as correct:
        a) the change in the landscape correspond to the error between the two images, thus the difference of the images
        (change) needs to be computed first, and then the norm of the change (difference) gives the magnitude of this
        change.
        b) if the norm of each matrix is computed first, this will not correspond to the change between two images.
        instead, it will correspond to a measurement of each of the images, and then the difference between them.
        c) example why difference of the norms of each image does not work: two images may have the same norm, but not
        be the same image. The difference of the norms will be zero, despite the fact that the images are not the same.
        A larger norm value indicates bigger changes of the measurements over time. smaller values indicate smaller
        changes over time.
