    You are designing a machine that produces parts whose lengths follow a
    normal distribution with mean $\mu = {{params.mu}}$ and standard deviation
    $\sigma = {{params.sigma}}$. However, only parts with lengths between
    {{params.minlen}} cm and {{params.maxlen}} cm can be used. Your task is to
    calculate the "yield rate", the expected percentage of parts that fall
    within this acceptable range. You can do this by integrating the normal
    distribution's probability density function (PDF), $$f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2
    \pi \sigma^2}} e^{-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2 \sigma^2}}$$ between
    {{params.minlen}} and {{params.maxlen}}. The normal PDF is shown below.

    <!--You are designing a machine that makes parts that-->
    <!--need to be within specific tolerances. The machine makes-->
    <!--parts that have lengths that are normally distributed with $\mu =-->
    <!--{{params.mu}}, \sigma = {{params.sigma}}$. However, you know that you can-->
    <!--only use parts with length at least {{params.minlen}} cm and at most-->
    <!--{{params.maxlen}} cm. Your goal is to calculate the "yield rate", the-->
    <!--expected percentage of parts that your machine creates that are within the-->
    <!--limits. You can do this by integrating the normal distribution's probability-->
    <!--density function (PDF), $$f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2}}-->
    <!--e^{-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2 \sigma^2}}$$ between {{params.minlen}} and-->
    <!--{{params.maxlen}}. The normal PDF is shown below.-->

    As you may know, it is very difficult to integrate the normal PDF
    analytically, so instead, you will find the yield rate through Monte Carlo
    simulations. Your solution must include the following steps:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Sketch the curve of the PDF shown above. Make sure your plot includes the range of allowed part lengths.
    </li>
    <li>
      Draw the rectangle that covers the region of interest i.e., the area
      within which you will place the random sample points when running Monte
      Carlo simulations. Explicitly label the lengths of each side.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you run $N$ Monte Carlo iterations and $N_p$ of the sampled points fall
      within the region of interest, what is the estimated yield rate? 
    </li>
  </ol>

      <strong>Tips for better image capture:</strong> Crop the image to focus
      only on your solution. Also consider taking the photo using your phone
      ("Use phone" button) instead of the computer webcam. You can usually get
      better lighting this way.

      <strong>Check if your work is correctly interpreted by an LLM model:</strong> When you click the "Save & Grade" button, we will show you how the LLM "reads" your submitted work. If you believe there are innacuracies, you may want to improve your submission (adjust the hand-writting, make sure lighting is good, etc).

    Students may sketch different rectangles: they must cover all possible $x
    \in [{{params.minlen}},{{params.maxlen}}]$ and height not shorter than the
    heighest point of the normal PDF within the $x$-range. However, if the width
    of the rectangle is $w$, and the height is $h$, then the correct answer in
    terms of formula is $\frac{N_p}{n} \times w \times h$
