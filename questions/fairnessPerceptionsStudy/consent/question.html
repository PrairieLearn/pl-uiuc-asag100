		<b>Studying the impact of explanation, policy, and stakes on student perceptions of fairness on an AI grader</b>
	</center>
	<br>
	You are being asked to participate in a voluntary research study.
	The purpose of this study is to understand how different
	types of explanation, course policies, and assignment stakes
	can influence students' perceptions of fairness on an AI grader.
	Results in this study will inform us on how to deploy an AI grader in the future.
	Participating in this study will involve completing a survey on PrairieLearn.
	Your participation will last about 15 minutes.
	We anticipate no risks greater than encountered in everyday life.
