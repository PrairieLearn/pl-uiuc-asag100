		<b>Disentangling the effect of grading policies on fairness perceptions in AI-assisted grading</b>
	</center>
	<br>
	You are being asked to participate in a voluntary research study. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of AI explanation and course policies on students’ perceptions of grading fairness. As a participant in this research study, you will first read a vignette and then complete a survey based on the vignette. We ask only that you grant permission for us to use your anonymized data to study ways to improve student experiences with an AI-based autograder. The potential risk for participating in this study is a breach of confidentiality, which will be minimized through secure data storage and removal of identifying information before analysis. To ensure that your participation is voluntary, your course instructors will never know who consented to participate in the study. All research data will be handled exclusively by researchers who are not affiliated with the course. There are no direct benefits to you for participating in this study. More broadly, this study will help identify the policies and system design features that most strongly support students’ perceptions of fairness and trustworthiness regarding AIbased grading. These insights will guide the development of AI graders that deliver more equitable, transparent, and consistent feedback. In turn, this will benefit future students by improving the quality of their learning experiences, reducing grading delays, and promoting fair assessment practices at scale.
