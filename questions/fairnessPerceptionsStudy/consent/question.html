		<b>Disentangling the effect of grading policies on fairness perceptions in AI-assisted grading</b>
	</center>
	<br>
	<p>
		You are being asked to participate in a voluntary research study.
		The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of
		AI explanation and course policies on students’ perceptions of grading fairness.
		As a participant in this research study, you will first read a vignette and
		then complete a survey based on the vignette.
		We ask only that you grant permission for us to use your anonymized data
		to study ways to improve student experiences with an AI-based autograder.
		The potential risk for participating in this study is a breach of confidentiality,
		which will be minimized through secure data storage and removal of identifying information before analysis.
		To ensure that your participation is voluntary, your course instructors will never know
		who consented to participate in the study.
		All research data will be handled exclusively by researchers who are not affiliated with the course.
		There are no direct benefits to you for participating in this study.
		More broadly, this study will help identify the policies and system design features
		that most strongly support students’ perceptions of fairness and trustworthiness regarding AIbased grading.
		These insights will guide the development of AI graders
		that deliver more equitable, transparent, and consistent feedback.
		In turn, this will benefit future students by improving the quality of their learning experiences,
		reducing grading delays, and promoting fair assessment practices at scale.

		<b>What procedures are involved? </b>
	</p>
	<p>
		To participate in this study, you will read a vignette and complete a survey about this vignette.
		In addition, you will be asked to complete some survey questions about
		your previous experiences with using AI and interacting with human graders.
		Your participation will last about 15 minutes. Your responses will be handled by researchers
		who are not affiliated with the course after the survey period,
		and all data will be de-identified before being used for research purposes.
		You will not be asked to do anything beyond providing your consent for your survey response to be included in
		the study.
	</p>
	<p>
		You will complete this survey in PrairieLearn. This PrairieLearn course instance
		that contains the survey is not accessible to your course instructors.

	<p>
		<b>How will the researchers protect my information?</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		Efforts will be made to protect your privacy and keep your information confidential. All identifiable data, such
		as names, student IDs, or email addresses, will be stored in secure, access-controlled Box folders managed by
		the research team. Only authorized research personnel will have access to these files. Once the data are
		de-identified, only anonymized datasets will be used for analysis and reporting. Your instructors and teaching
		staff will not have access to identifiable research data, and no information that could identify you will appear
		in any reports, publications, or presentations resulting from this study.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Who will have access to the information collected during this research study?</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		Only members of the approved research team will have access to identifiable data. University and government
		officials, research sponsors, and the Institutional Review Board (IRB) may review study records to ensure the
		study is conducted ethically and in compliance with regulations. We cannot promise complete secrecy, but every
		reasonable effort will be made to protect your confidentiality. No information that could identify you
		personally will be shared outside the research team or included in published findings.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Will I be reimbursed for any expenses or paid for my participation in this research?</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		You will receive 0.25% extra credit points for the completion of the survey, even if you do not allow your
		responses to be used for this research study.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Can I withdraw or be removed from the study?</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		If you decide to participate, you are free to withdraw your consent and discontinue participation at any time
		during the semester. Your participation in this research is voluntary. Your decision whether or not to
		participate, or to withdraw after beginning participation, will not affect your current or future dealings with
		the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Will data collected from me be used for any other research?</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		No. Your de-identified data will be used only for the research study described in this consent form, and will
		not be used for any other research or future studies.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>How might the information collected in this study be shared in the future?</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		De-identified data from this study may be stored in a secure research repository maintained by the Principal
		Investigator at the University of Illinois. The repository’s purpose is to identify the policies and system
		design features that most strongly support students’ perceptions of fair and trustworthy AIbased grading. The
		repository will only include the anonymized survey responses. Participation in the repository is not mandatory,
		only data from participants who consent to this study will be included. Access to the repository will be limited
		to authorized researchers approved by the Principal Investigator and the Institutional Review Board. Data will
		remain de-identified once stored; no personal identifiers will be retained. Because all identifying information
		will be removed, it will not be possible to withdraw your data from the repository after de-identification, and
		individual results or findings will not be returned to participants.
