        CS 357 has adopted a new autograding pipeline where students can
        submit their answers to a free response question
        and an AI grader will grade the response and provide feedback.
        The grader is available on this question:

            You are working with satellite images to monitor deforestation.
            The images are represented as large numerical matrices,
            one matrix for each time instance. Each matrix row corresponds to
            different measurements (e.g., temperature, vegetation index, soil moisture),
            and each column corresponds to a different location. All measurements are normalized
            so that differences in variance between them do not affect the analysis.

            You read that you can use the norm to measure how much the landscape has changed over time.
            Should you take the norm of
            the difference between two images or the difference of the norms of each image? Explain your answer.
            For this example, what does a larger norm value indicate compared to a smaller one?

        Kim, a student, completed a response to the question and submitted it to the platform. A few seconds after
        submitting
        the assignment, Kim received a grade of 50%.
