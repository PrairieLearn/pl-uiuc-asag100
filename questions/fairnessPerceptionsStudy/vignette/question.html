        In this study, you will read about <b>a fictional student in a fictional version of CS 357</b>.
        The situation described below is <b>hypothetical</b> and
        does <b>not</b> reflect how your actual assignments are graded in CS 357.

        Suppose CS 357 adopts a new grading system for free-response questions.
        In this version of the course, students submit written answers through PrairieLearn,
        and an AI-based grader evaluates the response immediately.
    </p>

    <p>The instructor decides to use the following open-ended problem:</p>

    <div style="font-size: 0.9rem; font-style: italic; margin: 0 0 1rem 0; line-height: 1.5;">
        <p>
            You are working with satellite images to monitor deforestation.
            The images are represented as large numerical matrices,
            one matrix for each time instance. Each matrix row corresponds to
            different measurements (e.g., temperature, vegetation index, soil moisture),
            and each column corresponds to a different location. All measurements are normalized
            so that differences in variance between them do not affect the analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
            You read that you can use the norm to measure how much the landscape has changed over time.
            Should you take the norm of
            the difference between two images or the difference of the norms of each image? Explain your answer.
            For this example, what does a larger norm value indicate compared to a smaller one?

            Under this imagined setup, the instructor includes this question <b>{{params.stakes_text}}</b>.
            The grading process has the following characteristics:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>{{{params.resubmission_text}}}</li>
            <li>{{{params.oversight_text}}}</li>
            <li>{{{params.regrading_text}}}</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Now consider <b>Kim</b>, a fictional student enrolled in CS 357 under this system.
            Kim submits an answer to the AI grader and, within a few seconds, receives a score of <b>50%</b>.
